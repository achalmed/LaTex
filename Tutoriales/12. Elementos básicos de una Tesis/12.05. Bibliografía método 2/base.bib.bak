  abstract      = {In this paper we analyze the stress field of a solid torus made of an incompressible isotropic solid with a toroidal inclusion that is concentric with the solid torus and has a uniform distribution of pure dilatational finite eigenstrains. We use a perturbation analysis and calculate the residual stresses to the first order in the thinness ratio (the ratio of the radius of the generating circle and the overall radius of the solid torus). In particular, we show that the stress field inside the inclusion is not uniform. This is in contrast with the corresponding results for infinitely-long and finite circular cylindrical bars and spherical balls with cylindrical and spherical inclusions, respectively. We also show that for a solid torus of any size made of an incompressible linear elastic solid with an inclusion with uniform (infinitesimal) pure dilatational eigenstrains the stress inside the inclusion is not uniform.},

  abstract      = {The electrochemical machining (ECM) is used to solve the difficult machining problem of metal screw pump stator inner hole; the mathematical model of electrolyte flow field in machining gap is established, and the distribution of electrolyte flow field in ECM machining gap of processing screw pump stator inner hole is simulated by using COMSOL simulation software. The simulation results show that, at the end of the machining gap, the electrolyte is not full, therefore setting up the added liquid hole on the cathode working zone by optimizing the cathode structure in the relevant machining gap zone to improve the distribution of flow field. Finally, the experiments are carried out which were conducted with different voltage and feed rate parameters; the test piece is sliced and measure it after the experiments, based on the measurement results to adjust the process parameters. The experiments result show that, when the processing voltage is 16 V and the feed rate is 6 mm/min, the distribution of electrolyte flow field in machining gap is more uniform, and the test piece size reached the product requirements. The simulation greatly shorten the cathode design cycle and optimize the structure of cathode by using COMSOL.},

  abstract      = {On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the formal inauguration of the Republic of Cuba (May 20, 1902), the then Historian of the City of Havana, Emilio Roig de Leuchsenring, decided to publish a memorial volume which would include various special studies on the progress made in the country during the preceding half century with regard to specific aspects of national collective life. The volume, entitled Facetas de la vida de Cuba republicana, 1902–1952 (Facets of Life in Republican Cuba, 1902–1952) appeared in print in 1954. Its publication was delayed—as Roig explained in his prologue, somewhat cryptically—“due to causes beyond our control or of that of the Cuban writers to whom we entrusted the preparation of the said studies.” Needless to say, the causes referred to were none other than those derived from the atmosphere of political unrest in the country after the military coup staged in March 1952 by former strongman, General Batista.},
